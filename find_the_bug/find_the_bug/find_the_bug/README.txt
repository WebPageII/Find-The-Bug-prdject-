Find the Bug Project

This is a README file. It’s a common way for developers to provide basic information to each other about a program - how it works, technical user documentation, contact information for the author, copyright, etc.

To see the instructions for this assignment, open the file find_the_bug.html (in the folder PartA) in your browser and follow the directions.
